# Python 1 Exam Project - Help the Police Catch the Criminals

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or higher
* A console from which you can run Python scripts.

## How to run
### Bash
Simply type the following in your `bash` terminal while being in the `python1ExamProject` folder:

````bash
python3.7 main.py
````

_Switch out `3.7` with your version number, if you're running a newer version of Python._

### CMD / PowerShell
I have no idea. Why are you even running Windows?
___

Once running, the program should be pretty self-explanatory. Just make sure that both `main.py` and
 `SacramentocrimJanuary2006.csv` are both present in the folder, when running the script.
